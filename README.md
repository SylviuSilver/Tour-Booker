Introduction
Trip Booker is a pre-planned application where a user can choose the services and trips offer by Trip Booker. This Application is for those who are finding problem in planning their trips for their family and friends and wants to take them to their trips.

Trip Booker application consist of:
Register
Member list
Trip selector option
Customization option
Receipt
Payment option

 
 
In Registration, User will give his/her information 
In Member Details, User will give us all the information about the members who will be joining in his trip. And also will be asked if there is anyone with medical condition to give him extra service.
In Trips, user will select a trip whatever is offered by Trip Booker platform and the organisation. User will be shown the price of each trip along with the trip name.

In customisation, User will select a what transport he will use as per what he needs and Extra Services offered by Trip Booker. 
When the user submits his info all the information will be stored in database of the Trip Booker and then his receipt will be shown in the receipt area.

Calculation: -
We have considered No. of people, which trip they select, what services they taken and which transport they opted to calculate the total of bill. 
 Trip cost = trip selected cost
 extra service = Selected Service opted by User
Each service pricing: -
Toolkit = Rs 50 / No. of members
Security = Rs 30/ luggage 
Child-Care = Rs 150/No. of Child
Transport = Selected transport*no. of members (children and Adult)
Train: 
Rs 150/Adult
Rs 130/Child
Flight: 
Rs 5000/Adult
Rs 3000/Child
Bus: 
Rs 450/Adult
Rs 350/Child
Van: 
Rs 650/Adult
Rs 550/Adult

And the Grand total = Trip Cost + Extra Service Cost + Transport Cost


When user press Pay Option he will be redirected to payment portal where he will be asked to scan and pay through UPI payment option. And then he will be asked to conform the payment if he say “yes” then the payment portal will be open and if he say “no” he will be asked to pay along and redirected to payment portal.


This is the small project that will help people who wants to select a trip pre planned for them with an appropriate price.
